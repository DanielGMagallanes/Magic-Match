## Project Description
Our project will allow users to collect Magic: The Gathering cards and play a simple game of Magic: The Gathering. A website will be deployed to house user accounts that contain their card collection, profile information, and win/loss record. The user will start off with a certain amount of tokens when they sign-up. Those can then be used to buy card packs. There is also a log-in bonus for signing into the website. Another way to earn more tokens is to participate in the Memory Game. 
	In the Memory Game a few cards are shown on screen for a certain amount of time, showing an illustration, then they are flipped over and shuffled. The objective of the game is to find as many matches as possible. The player who picks the most matching pairs wins the game. In the game there will be a reward system where both players get a bonus for playing in a match. Both the winner and losing player will receive tokens. A player will be able to see the result of the past games that they were in.
A user can simply look up cards by their name or card id, but the user wonâ€™t officially own them. The user will be able to post a possible trade by selecting one of their cards. The user can offer up one of their cards as a response to the poster. The poster will then accept or decline the trade.
